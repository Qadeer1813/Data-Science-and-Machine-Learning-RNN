# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM layers to generate poetry-like text character-by-character. The model learns the structure, style, and patterns of Emily Dickinson‚Äôs poems by analyzing the sequence of characters within them.

# Algorithims:
Recurrent Neural Networks: RNNs are a type of neural network designed for sequential data. They maintain memory of previous inputs, making them ideal for tasks like text generation. In this project, an RNN with LSTM layers was used to learn and generate poetry character by character.
